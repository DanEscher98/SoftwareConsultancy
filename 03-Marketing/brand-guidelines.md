I loved the format of your answer. Here is the response of Gemini with the same prompt. Improve your response taking the good of its response. Not now, but later I'll use your response as part of a prompt to create the corporate culture description, create compelling job ads to seek talent, presentations to attract investors, the pitch to convince clients, etc. So if need add at the end clarifying notes so I can use it later as a prompt.
